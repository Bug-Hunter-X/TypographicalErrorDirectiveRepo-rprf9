The solution involves double-checking your Tailwind CSS configuration (tailwind.config.js or similar) to ensure that the class `bg-blue-500` is correctly defined and spelled.  If it's a custom class, verify its correct definition within your CSS or using the `@layer` functionality.

If the class exists and the issue persists, carefully check for typos in the class name within the `@apply` directive.  Case sensitivity is crucial.

Corrected code:

```html
<div class="bg-red-500 bg-blue-500">
</div>
```

Or, if you intend to use `@apply`, ensure `bg-blue-500` is a valid Tailwind class.
