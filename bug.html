This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that doesn't exist or has a typo.  For example:

```html
<div class="bg-red-500 @apply bg-blue-500">
</div>
```

If `bg-blue-500` is not a valid Tailwind CSS utility class, this will cause a build error or unexpected behavior.
